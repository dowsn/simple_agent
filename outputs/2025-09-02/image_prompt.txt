Create a vibrant, colorful digital illustration showing the AI inference process as a dynamic data flow. Feature a stylized human brain or head silhouette on the left side with colorful neural network patterns, connected by flowing streams of bright, multi-colored data particles (blues, purples, oranges, greens, and pinks) that transform and organize into organized patterns on the right side. Include floating geometric shapes, circuit board elements, and glowing nodes throughout the composition. Add subtle Google TPU chip imagery integrated into the design. Use a modern gradient background transitioning from deep blues to bright magentas and yellows. The overall style should be sleek, tech-forward, and visually engaging with plenty of luminous, saturated colors that convey intelligence, processing power, and digital transformation.. Please follow this stylistic guidelines: nice image with a lot fo colors.
