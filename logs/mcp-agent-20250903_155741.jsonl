Classification strategy (use BOTH domain AND content):\n               a. Domain indicators:\n                  - .edu domains \u2192 likely \"school\"\n                  - Corporate domains \u2192 likely \"company\"\n                  - Gmail/Yahoo/personal \u2192 likely \"personal\"\n               \n               b. Content indicators (override domain when clear):\n                  - Educational keywords (course, program, student, university, degree) \u2192 \"school\"\n                  - Business keywords (partnership, services, proposal, meeting, sales) \u2192 \"company\"\n                  - Personal keywords (thanks, personal inquiry, casual tone) \u2192 \"personal\"\n                  - Newsletters, automated messages \u2192 \"other\"\n               \n               c. Final decision:\n                  - If content clearly indicates type, use content classification\n                  - If content is ambiguous, use domain classification\n                  - If both unclear, classify as \"other\"\n            \n            3. Update the row in spreadsheet with:\n               - type: classified type\n               - status: initial status based on type\n                 * school \u2192 \"new\"\n                 * company \u2192 \"lead\"\n                 * personal \u2192 \"active\"\n                 * other \u2192 \"pending\"\n            \n            4.

For each email with empty 'type' field in spreadsheet:\n               a. Get full email content using gmail_get_thread with thread_id\n               b. Analyze BOTH sender's domain AND email content\n               c. Classify as one of: \"school\", \"company\", \"personal\", \"other\"\n               \n            2. Classification strategy (use BOTH domain AND content):\n               a. Domain indicators:\n                  - .edu domains \u2192 likely \"school\"\n                  - Corporate domains \u2192 likely \"company\"\n                  - Gmail/Yahoo/personal \u2192 likely \"personal\"\n               \n               b. Content indicators (override domain when clear):\n                  - Educational keywords (course, program, student, university, degree) \u2192 \"school\"\n                  - Business keywords (partnership, services, proposal, meeting, sales) \u2192 \"company\"\n                  - Personal keywords (thanks, personal inquiry, casual tone) \u2192 \"personal\"\n                  - Newsletters, automated messages \u2192 \"other\"\n               \n               c. Final decision:\n                  - If content clearly indicates type, use content classification\n                  - If content is ambiguous, use domain classification\n                  - If both unclear, classify as \"other\"\n            \n            3. Update the row in spreadsheet with:\n               - type: classified type\n               - status: initial status based on type\n                 * school \u2192 \"new\"\n                 * company \u2192 \"lead\"\n                 * personal \u2192 \"active\"\n                 * other \u2192 \"pending\"\n            \n            4. Use sheets_lookup_row to find unclassified emails\n            5. Use gmail_get_thread to get email content for analysis\n            6. Use sheets_update_row to update type and status\n            "}}}
