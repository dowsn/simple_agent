Check Gmail for new emails using gmail_find_email tool\n            2. Use query: \"in:inbox after:{last_check_date}\"\n               - Format date as: after:YYYY/MM/DD or use relative like after:1d\n            3. For EACH new email found:\n               a. Extract: sender email, subject, message_id, thread_id, received date\n               b. Check if email exists in spreadsheet (lookup by message_id)\n               c. If new, create row with these columns:\n                  - email: sender's email address\n                  - subject: email subject line\n                  - message_id: unique Gmail ID\n                  - thread_id: conversation thread ID\n                  - received_date: when received\n                  - type: (leave empty for classification)\n                  - status: \"new\"\n                  - action_required: 1 if needs response, 0 if FYI/newsletter\n                  - notes: (empty initially)\n                  - last_processed: current timestamp\n               d.

Final decision:\n                  - If content clearly indicates type, use content classification\n                  - If content is ambiguous, use domain classification\n                  - If both unclear, classify as \"other\"\n            \n            3. Update the row in spreadsheet with:\n               - type: classified type\n               - status: initial status based on type\n                 * school \u2192 \"new\"\n                 * company \u2192 \"lead\"\n                 * personal \u2192 \"active\"\n                 * other \u2192 \"pending\"\n            \n            4.
