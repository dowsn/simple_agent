But most AI Engineers do not train models, they are just users of them. How can they play a part? If you could never update the weights, how would you have the model increase its performance on a specific task? I think of that as <strong>inference-time self-improvement</strong>, with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291\">Voyager</a> being one of the early approaches to this through its skill library.</p><p>Since I started working on <a href=\"https://www.kernellabs.ai\">Kernel Labs</a> (more on that soon &#128064;), parallelizing coding agents with things like <a href=\"https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad\">claude-squad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vibekanban.com\">vibe-kanban</a> has been one of the most effective productivity hacks. When Boris Cherny called Claude Code a &#8220;unix utility&#8221; in <a href=\"https://www.latent.space/p/claude-code\">our interview</a>, it really clicked for me. <strong>The most valuable use case of coding agents is being a vessel for LLMs to extract value out of their own latent spaces.</strong> </p><p>How do we optimize for that? Can models do it themselves? Since I got access to GPT-5, I spent the whole time playing around with this flow: </p><ul><li><p>I started by asking the model to build a set of tools it thought would help it be more productive</p></li><li><p>Attempt a task using them, with me supervising it</p></li><li><p>After completion, self-reflect on how the tools could be improved</p></li></ul><p>I also compared this to Opus 4 (4.1 was not out yet). The good news is that GPT-5 is a very good model for building developer utilities. The bad news is that it hates using the tools it creates! As it told me <em><strong>\"I'll be honest - I didn't need an\n\n<error>Content truncated.
