But what if we could understand it?</p><p>In Oct '24 OpenAI released <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/mle-bench/\">MLE Bench</a>, a benchmark that measures how well LLMs do at machine learning engineering. The self-improving trajectory through ML Engineering is driven by better algorithms, cleaner data, and more efficient memory usage: <strong>training-time self-improvement</strong>. But most AI Engineers do not train models, they are just users of them. How can they play a part? If you could never update the weights, how would you have the model increase its performance on a specific task? I think of that as <strong>inference-time self-improvement</strong>, with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291\">Voyager</a> being one of the early approaches to this through its skill library.</p><p>Since I started working on <a href=\"https://www.kernellabs.ai\">Kernel Labs</a> (more on that soon &#128064;), parallelizing coding agents with things like <a href=\"https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad\">claude-squad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vibekanban.com\">vibe-kanban</a> has been one of the most effective productivity hacks.
